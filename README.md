# Clarifying Questions & Assumptions

**1. Should the data be completely static or should we simulate `random updates` every few seconds?**

**2. Do we need to support multiple themes like `dark mode` and `light mode`?**

**3. Should the `chart` in the details drawer be interactive or just a `static view`?**

**4. Is it okay to use `libraries` like `Chart.js` for the chart, or should we build it from scratch?**

**5. Do you want `animations` when `toggling` between `View A` and `View B`?**

<br>

# Implemented Features

- **Display `6 stock cards` per row on desktop and wrap on smaller screens**
- **Show stock details like `Trading Symbol`, `Capital Market Price`, `Futures Price`, `Percentage Change`, and `last updated time`**
- **`Toggle` between two views for `price comparison`**
- **`Search bar` to filter by Trading Symbol**
- **`Sort` options by `percentage change`, `capital market price`, and `futures price`**
- **Open `details drawer` with a `dummy chart`using `random` data and stock information**
- **Show `error state` when data is `missing`**
- **`Refresh` button to `reload data`**
- **Show `loading skeletons` when data is being `fetched`**
- **`Retry` option if an `error occurs`**
- **`Unit tests` for main functionalities**

<br>

# Tradeoffs and Next Steps

- **The chart uses `random data` instead of real market data**

- **`Error simulation` is random and may not cover all possible edge cases**

- **The UI could be improved with more `animations` and `transitions`**

- **Adding real `API` integration would make the app more `useful`**

<br>

# Originality & Problem-solving

In this project, I `carefully thought` about how users would interact with a `stock watchlist app`. I built the app with my `own structure` and `logic`.

- ## Some problem-solving steps I took:

  - **I used dummy data and simulated data fetching using `setTimeout` to create a real-like experience without using an `API`.**
  - **I implemented `error handling`, so if the data is missing or a fetch fails, the app shows a `user-friendly message` instead of crashing.**
  - **I structured the code with reusable components like `StockCard`, `ErrorState`, and `FilterDrawer`, `More` so it is clean and easy to manage.**
  - **I wrote `unit tests` using `Jest` and React `Testing Library` to check that the main functionalities work as expected.**
  - **I used `styling`, and `transitions` to make the interface smooth and intuitive.**

  ### These steps helped me solve challenges like handling missing data, improving responsiveness, and making the app user-friendly.

# Extra Improvements

### I checked the project with Lighthouse and made sure it follows the best practices. All important parts like: 

- ### Navigation(Default) Scores: [Navigation Report Pdf üìë](LightHouseReport/Navigation.pdf)
  - `Performance:` **100**
  - `Accessibility:` **100**
  - `Best Practices:` **100**
  - `SEO:` **100** 

  ![Navigation Scores](LightHouseReport/NavigationDefault.jpg)

- ### Snapshot Scores:  [Snapshot Report Pdf üìë](LightHouseReport/SnapShot.pdf)
  - `Performance:` **4/4**  
  - `Accessibility:` **23/23**  
  - `Best Practices:` **5/5** 
  - `SEO:` **5/5**  

  ![Snapshot Scores](LightHouseReport/Snapshot.jpg)


- ### Timespan Scores:  [Timespan Report Pdf üìë](LightHouseReport/TimeStamp-Report.pdf)
  - `Performance:` **11/11**  
  - `Best Practices:` **8/8**

### This means the app loads fast, works well on all devices, is easy to use by everyone, and is ready for search engines. These improvements show that I care about making a good and professional project.

# What I fixed to get 100%

- ## Here are the things I improved to make the app better and get 100% in all important parts like `Performance`, `Accessibility`, Best `Practices`, and `SEO`:

  - **‚úîÔ∏è Optimized images by `resizing` them and using next-gen formats like `WebP`**

  - **‚úîÔ∏è Used responsive images with right `size` loads on `different screens`**

  - **‚úîÔ∏è Added `width` and `height` to images to prevent layout shift and make `loading faster`**

  - **‚úîÔ∏è Made sure important images like the `logo` are not `lazy loaded` for better performance**

  - **‚úîÔ∏è Fixed the wrong `HTML tags`**

  - **‚úîÔ∏è Added a `meta description` to help search engines `understand the Webpage`**

  - **‚úîÔ∏è Checked Lighthouse `scores` and `fixed` all `issues` they showed**

  - **‚úîÔ∏è Made the `navigation` `smooth` and followed best `practices` for `faster loading` and `better experien`**

  ## These changes helped the app to be fast, user-friendly, and professional.
