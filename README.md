     alt="npm install Screenshot" 
     width="500" 
     style="border: 3px solid #8DCF29; border-radius: 10px; box-shadow: 0px 0px 10px 8px rgba(141,207,41,0.4); padding: 10px;" />

### 2. Start the Development Server

Once dependencies are installed, start the app in development mode:

```
npm run dev
```

Open your browser and visit: http://localhost:5173

# Clarifying Questions & Assumptions

 ### 1. Should the data be completely static or should we simulate `random updates` every few seconds?

 ### 2. Do we need to support multiple themes like `dark mode` and `light mode`?

 ### 3. Should the `chart` in the details drawer be interactive or just a `static view`?

 ### 4. Is it okay to use `libraries` like `Chart.js` for the chart, or should we build it from scratch?

 ### 5. Do you want `animations` when `toggling` between `View A` and `View B`?

<br><br>

# Implemented Features

- ### Display `6 stock cards` per row on desktop and wrap on smaller screens
- ### Show stock details like `Trading Symbol`, `Capital Market Price`, `Futures Price`, `Percentage Change`, and `last updated time`
- ### `Toggle` between two views for `price comparison`
- ### `Search bar` to filter by Trading Symbol
- ### `Sort` options by `percentage change`, `capital market price`, and `futures price`
- ### Open `details drawer` with a `dummy chart`using `random` data and stock information
- ### Show `error state` when data is `missing`
- ### `Refresh` button to `reload data`
- ### Show `loading skeletons` when data is being `fetched`
- ### `Retry` option if an `error occurs`
- ### `Unit tests` for main functionalities

<br><br>

# Tradeoffs and Next Steps

- ### The chart uses `random data` instead of real market data

- ### `Error simulation` is random and may not cover all possible edge cases

- ### The UI could be improved with more `animations` and `transitions`

- ### Adding real `API` integration would make the app more `useful`

<br><br>

# Originality & Problem-solving

In this project, I `carefully thought` about how users would interact with a `stock watchlist app`. I built the app with my `own structure` and `logic`.

- ## Some problem-solving steps I took:

    - ### I used dummy data and simulated data fetching using `setTimeout` to create a real-like experience without using an `API`.
    - ### I implemented `error handling`, so if the data is missing or a fetch fails, the app shows a `user-friendly message` instead of crashing.
    - ### I structured the code with reusable components like `StockCard`, `ErrorState`, and `FilterDrawer`, `More` so it is clean and easy to manage.
    - ### I wrote `unit tests` using `Jest` and React `Testing Library` to check that the main functionalities work as expected.
    - ### I used `styling`, and `transitions` to make the interface smooth and intuitive.

    ## These steps helped me solve challenges like handling missing data, improving responsiveness, and making the app user-friendly.
